# WS Trade Info
Collection of information about Wealthsimple Trade


# Asset Information
The `stock_info` folder contains information about assets traded in Canada, NASDAQ and NYSE
I made the decision to keep Canadian Assets together since Wealthsimple does not charge fees to trade them.

### Canada
Currently lists *1622* Canadian assets traded in TSX, TSX-V and NEO, from `Acasti Pharma Inc (Class A)` (ACST) to `BMO Tactical Dividend ETF Fund` (ZZZD)

# Recently Changed / Added

The `change_info` folder contains information about assets that went through change recently. For example, it contains recent and to be added IPOs. It also contains all the de-listed and split stocks. This info might not be up to date at the time of your reading, since it requires daily changes. Last updated October 7th 2020.
